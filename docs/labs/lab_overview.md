# Labs Overview

These versions of the Labs contain additional annotations to the Rmarkdown files. The annotations emphasize some key aspects of text analaysis, processing, coding, and document design and are indended to help support your progress.

 
```{warning}

What is in this documentation is **not** identical to what is in the Rmarkdown. For one, it omits the **tasks**, which you are asked to complete and submit. These are not included as those change from course to course.

Also, these supplementary materials were prepared using simple markdown (rather than Rmarkdown). Thus, their details and layout are not identical.
