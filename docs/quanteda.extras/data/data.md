## `sample_corpus`

### Description

The corpus contains data from 8 text-types:

- Academic
- Blog
- Fiction
- Magazine
- News
- Spoken
- Television & Movie
- Web

Its compilation follows the sampling procedures of the [Corpus of Contemporary American English](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/). However, it contains only 50 texts from each type, and each text is only about 2,500 words.

Thus, it is similar to the [Brown family of corpora](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/w3c/corpus_ling/content/corpora/list/private/brown/brown.html) in its size (roughly 1 million words).
